Represenational State Transfer (Rest) {
 
 - A convention, or agreed-upon recommendation, for naming and organzing API endpoints.
  
  An endpoint should never deal with one or more resourse!


Think of everything as a resource ( user, comment, etc)

Each resource should have a unique URL
e.g: /id /user 

URls shoould utilize HTTP methods for operations
